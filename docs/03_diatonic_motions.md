### II-V-I

#### $ii^7-V^7-I$

- **Bach JS, BWV 846 m9:** With 5-voice harmony, the doubling of 3rds seems the way to go, except for the leading tone (on V7). ![](../images/03_diatonic_motions/Bach_JS-BWV_846_m9.png)

- **Bach JS, BWV 846 m2:** With the ii's 7th in bass, held over from previous I. Bass does 1-1-7-1. Very prolongational. ![](../images/03_diatonic_motions/Bach_JS-BWV_846_m2.png)
