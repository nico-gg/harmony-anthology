05_sequences,Bach JS,BWV 846,m5,The final chord with the 7th in the bass is worthy of notice. This is smootly handled by the voice leading.
03_diatonic_motions,Bach JS,BWV 846,m9,"With 5-voice harmony, the doubling of 3rds seems the way to go, except for the leading tone (on V7)."
04_chromatic_devices,Bach JS,BWV 846,m11,The are many things at play in this passage. I still feel like this is made smoother by  this chord being coherent as IV of D melodic minor.
04_chromatic_devices,Bach JS,BWV 846,m11,"In minor, this motion can occur in as part of a modal shift from melodic to harmonic (it is one possible analysis of this passage). The doubled 3rd in the first chord are sent through contrary motion to the 2 diminished neighboring notes. Another elegant 5 voice trick."

04_chromatic_devices,Bach JS,BWV 846,m21,"This double motion must be rare in classical settings, but occurs here because of the major 7th on IV, probably to be analysed as full-length suspension from the previous chord."
04_chromatic_devices,Bach JS,BWV 846,m27,"On a V pedal, otherwise very textbook."
